# favorite-movie-list
A simple web application, that hits an api, and saves your favorite movies in a list. The database is NoSQL, and the server is Node.js.

1) I connected with some an IMDB API, and allowed it to get me a wide list of movies.
2) After that I saved the movies that you chose into a database.
3) I later show the movies you save in a list.
